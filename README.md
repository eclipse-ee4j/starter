# Eclipse Starter for Jakarta EE

This is the official Eclipse Foundation Starter for Jakarta EE. It generates code to help get started with Jakarta EE projects using Maven. It is possible to do so using Maven Archetypes or a web UI.

## Current Release

Please note that this is a development version of the starter. For the current release, please visit the [project website](https://start.jakarta.ee) or use Maven Central. This code will allow you to use features that are not yet released. It will also allow you to build the starter from source.

## Building from Source

In order to build the project from source, please download this repository on your file system (the easiest way may be to [download as zip](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/starter/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)). Then execute the following. Please ensure you have installed a [Java SE 11+ implementation](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk11) and [Maven 3+](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) (we have tested with Java SE 11 and Java SE 17).

```
mvn clean install
```

## Generate Jakarta EE Project Using Archetypes 
In order to run the Maven Archetype and generate a sample Jakarta EE project, please execute the following. Please ensure you have installed a [Java SE 8+ implementation](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk8) and [Maven 3+](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) (we have tested with Java SE 8, Java SE 11 and Java SE 17).

```
mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId="org.eclipse.starter" -DarchetypeArtifactId="jakarta-starter"
```

If you use the defaults, this will generate the Jakarta EE project under a directory named `jakartaee-hello-world`. The README.md file under that directory will contain instructions on how to run the sample.

If desired, you can easily use the Maven Archetype from a Maven capable IDE such as [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/ide). The generated starter code is simply Maven projects. You can easily load, explore and run the code in a Maven capable IDE such as [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/ide).

To run a specific version of the Archetype, including the locally installed development version, specify the `archetypeVersion` property.

```
mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId="org.eclipse.starter" -DarchetypeArtifactId="jakarta-starter" -DarchetypeVersion="2.5.0-SNAPSHOT"
```

##  Running the UI
In order to run the UI, please execute the following from this directory. You can also simply build the war from Maven and deploy the war to either WildFly 26 or JBoss EAP 7.4. You can do this in an IDE if desired. Note that you can override the underlying archetype version used by setting the `ARCHETYPE_VERSION` environment variable (the default version will be the most recent released to Maven Central, see [here](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.eclipse.starter/jakarta-starter) for the latest value).

```
mvn clean package wildfly:dev --file ui/pom.xml
```

Once WildFly starts, please go to [http://localhost:8080/jakarta-starter-ui/](http://localhost:8080/jakarta-starter-ui/). Unzip the file the UI generates and follow the README.md in the unzipped directory.
