# Eclipse Starter for Jakarta EE
This is the official Eclipse Foundation starter for Jakarta EE. It generates code to help get started with Jakarta EE projects using Maven. It is possible to do so using a Maven Archetype. In the future the Starter will include a Web UI.

## Current Release
Please note that this is a development version of the starter. For the current release, please visit the [project website](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/starter/). This code will allow you to use features that are not yet released. It will also allow you to build the starter from source.

## Building Maven Archetype from Source
In order to build the Maven Archetype from source, please download this repository on your file system (the easiest way may be to [download as zip](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/starter/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)). Then execute (please ensure you have installed a [Java SE 8+ implementation](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk8) and [Maven 3+](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)):

```
mvn clean install
```

## Generate Jakarta EE Project
In order to run the Maven Archetype and generate a sample Jakarta EE project, please execute (please ensure you have installed a [Java SE 8+ implementation](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk8) and [Maven 3+](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)):

```
mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId="org.eclipse.starter" -DarchetypeArtifactId="jakarta-starter" -DarchetypeVersion="1.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
```

Note that by default the Archetype will use Payara as the Jakarta EE runtime. You can use GlassFish or TomEE instead (please see the sections below for the commands to execute instead).

If desired, you can easily use the Maven Archetype from a Maven capable IDE such as [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/ide).

If you use the defaults, this will generate the Jakarta EE project under a directory named `jakartaee-cafe`. You can then run the project by executing the following command from the `jakartaee-cafe` directory (please ensure you have installed a [Java SE 8+ implementation](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk8) and [Maven 3+](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)):

```
mvn clean package payara-micro:start
```

Once Payara Micro starts, you can access the project at http://localhost:8080.

You can also run the project via Docker. To build the Docker image, execute the following commands from the `jakartaee-cafe` directory (please ensure you have installed a [Java SE 8+ implementation](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk8), [Maven 3+](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)): 

```
mvn clean package
docker build -t jakartaee-cafe:v1 .
```

You can then run the Docker image by executing:

```
docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 jakartaee-cafe:v1
```

Once Payara starts, you can access the project at http://localhost:8080/jakartaee-cafe.

The generated starter code is simply a Maven project. You can easily load, explore and run the code in a Maven capable IDE such as [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/ide).

## GlassFish
* To generate a sample Jakarta EE project with GlassFish, please execute the following (please ensure you have installed a [Java SE 8 implementation](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk8) and [Maven 3+](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)). Please note that the generated application will only work with Java SE 8 for GlassFish 5.

  ```
  mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId="org.eclipse.starter" -DarchetypeArtifactId="jakarta-starter" -DarchetypeVersion="1.1.0-SNAPSHOT" -Druntime="glassfish"
  ```

* To run the generated project with GlassFish, please execute the following from the project directory - named `jakartaee-cafe` by default. Please ensure you have installed a [Java SE 8 implementation](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk8) and [Maven 3+](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).

  ```
  mvn clean package cargo:run
  ```
 
  Once GlassFish starts, you can access the project at http://localhost:8080/jakartaee-cafe.
  Note that GlassFish currently does not include an official Docker image.
  
## TomEE
* To generate a sample Jakarta EE project with TomEE, please execute the following (please ensure you have installed a [Java SE 8+ implementation](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk8) and [Maven 3+](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)).

  ```
  mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId="org.eclipse.starter" -DarchetypeArtifactId="jakarta-starter" -DarchetypeVersion="1.1.0-SNAPSHOT" -Druntime="tomee"
  ```

* To run the generated project with TomEE, please execute the following from the project directory - named `jakartaee-cafe` by default. Please ensure you have installed a [Java SE 8+ implementation](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk8) and [Maven 3+](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).

  ```
  mvn clean package tomee:run
  ```
 
  Once TomEE starts, you can access the project at http://localhost:8080/jakartaee-cafe.

* To run the generated project with TomEE and Docker, execute the following commands from the `jakartaee-cafe` directory (please ensure you have installed a [Java SE 8+ implementation](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk8), [Maven 3+](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)).

  ```
  mvn clean package
  docker build -t jakartaee-cafe:v1 .
  docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 jakartaee-cafe:v1
  ```
  
  Once TomEE starts, you can access the project at http://localhost:8080/jakartaee-cafe.

## Roadmap
The following is a high level roadmap for the project. All contributions are welcome advancing any of this work.
* Add support for other [Jakarta EE compatible runtimes](https://jakarta.ee/compatibility) such as WildFly and Open Liberty.
* Transition to Jakarta EE 9.1.
* Add instructions for Eclipse IDE.
* Improve look and feel.
* Add starter UI capability.
* Add support for generating a Faces UI instead of REST.
