# Eclipse Starter for Jakarta EE
This is a sample application generated by the Eclipse Foundation starter for Jakarta EE.

## Running the Application
#if (${runtime} == 'payara')
You can run the application by executing the following command from the directory where this file resides. Please ensure you have installed a [Java SE 8+ implementation](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk8) (we have tested with Java SE 8, Java SE 11 and Java SE 17). Note, the [Maven Wrapper](https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/) is already included in the project, so a Maven install is not actually needed.

```
#if (${profile} != 'full')
./mvnw clean package payara-micro:start
#else
./mvnw clean package cargo:run
#end
```

#if (${profile} != 'full')
Once Payara Micro starts, you can access the project at http://localhost:8080.
#else
Once Payara starts, you can access the project at http://localhost:8080/jakartaee-hello-world.
#end

#if (${docker} == 'yes')
You can also run the project via Docker. To build the Docker image, execute the following commands from the directory where this file resides. Please ensure you have installed a [Java SE 8+ implementation](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk8) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (we have tested with Java SE 8, Java SE 11 and Java SE 17). Note, the [Maven Wrapper](https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/) is already included in the project, so a Maven install is not actually needed.

```
./mvnw clean package
docker build -t jakartaee-hello-world:v1 .
```

You can then run the Docker image by executing:

```
docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 jakartaee-hello-world:v1
```

Once Payara starts, you can access the project at http://localhost:8080/jakartaee-hello-world.

#elseif (${runtime} == 'glassfish')
* You can run the application by executing the following command from the directory where this file resides. Please ensure you have installed a [Java SE 8 implementation](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk8). Note, the [Maven Wrapper](https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/) is already included in the project, so a Maven install is not actually needed.

  ```
  ./mvnw clean package cargo:run
  ```
 
  Once GlassFish starts, you can access the project at http://localhost:8080/jakartaee-hello-world.
#elseif (${runtime} == 'tomee')
* To run the generated project with TomEE, please execute the following from the project directory where this file resides. Please ensure you have installed a [Java SE 8+ implementation](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk8) (we have tested with Java SE 8, Java SE 11 and Java SE 17). Note, the [Maven Wrapper](https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/) is already included in the project, so a Maven install is not actually needed.If you're running a Jakarta 9 project you must have installed at least [Java SE 11+ implementation](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk11)

  ```
  ./mvnw clean package tomee:run
  ```
 
  Once TomEE starts, you can access the project at http://localhost:8080/jakartaee-hello-world.

#if (${docker} == 'yes')
* To run the generated project with TomEE and Docker, execute the following commands from the directory where this file resides. Please ensure you have installed a [Java SE 8+ implementation](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk8) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (we have tested with Java SE 8, Java SE 11 and Java SE 17). Note, the [Maven Wrapper](https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/) is already included in the project, so a Maven install is not actually needed.If you're running a Jakarta 9 project you must have installed at least [Java SE 11+ implementation](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk11)

  ```
  ./mvnw clean package
  docker build -t jakartaee-hello-world:v1 .
  docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 jakartaee-hello-world:v1
  ```
  
  Once TomEE starts, you can access the project at http://localhost:8080/jakartaee-hello-world.
#end
#else
* You can build the application by executing the following command from the directory where this file resides. Please ensure you have installed a [Java SE 8 implementation](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk8). Note, the [Maven Wrapper](https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/) is already included in the project, so a Maven install is not actually needed.

  ```
  ./mvnw clean package
  ```
 
  This will generate a file named `jakartaee-hello-world.war`. You should be able to run the application by deploying the file to
  a [Jakarta EE compatible runtime](https://jakarta.ee/compatibility).
