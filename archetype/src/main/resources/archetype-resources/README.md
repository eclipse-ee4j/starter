# Eclipse Starter for Jakarta EE
This is a sample application generated by the Eclipse Foundation starter for Jakarta EE.

## Running the Application
#if (${runtime} != 'none')
You can run the application by executing the following command from the directory where this file resides. 
Please ensure you have installed a [Java SE implementation](https://adoptium.net) appropriate for your 
Jakarta EE version and runtime choice (this sample assumes Java SE ${javaVersion}). Note, 
the [Maven Wrapper](https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/) is already included in the project, so a Maven install 
is not actually needed. You may first need to execute `chmod +x mvnw`.

```
#if ((${runtime} == 'payara') && (${profile} != 'full'))
./mvnw clean package payara-micro:start
#elseif ((${runtime} == 'payara') || (${runtime} == 'glassfish'))
./mvnw clean package cargo:run
#elseif (${runtime} == 'tomee')
./mvnw clean package tomee:run
#elseif (${runtime} == 'wildfly')
./mvnw clean package wildfly:run
#elseif (${runtime} == 'open-liberty')
./mvnw clean package liberty:run
#end
```

#if ((${runtime} == 'payara') && (${profile} != 'full'))
#if (${profile} != 'core')
Once the runtime starts, you can access the project at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
#else
Once the runtime starts, you can access the REST end-point at [http://localhost:8080/rest/hello](http://localhost:8080/rest/hello).
#end
#elseif (${runtime} == 'open-liberty')
#if (${profile} != 'core')
Once the runtime starts, you can access the project at [http://localhost:9080](http://localhost:9080).
#else
Once the runtime starts, you can access the REST end-point at [http://localhost:9080/rest/hello](http://localhost:9080/rest/hello).
#end
#else
#if (${profile} != 'core')
Once the runtime starts, you can access the project at [http://localhost:8080/${artifactId}](http://localhost:8080/${artifactId}).
#else
Once the runtime starts, you can access the REST end-point at [http://localhost:8080/${artifactId}/rest/hello](http://localhost:8080/${artifactId}/rest/hello).
#end
#end

#if ((${docker} == 'yes') and (${runtime} != 'glassfish'))
You can also run the project via Docker. To build the Docker image, execute the following commands from the 
directory where this file resides. Please ensure you have installed 
a [Java SE implementation](https://adoptium.net) appropriate for your Jakarta EE version/runtime 
choice (this sample assumes Java SE ${javaVersion}) and 
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Note, 
the [Maven Wrapper](https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/) is already included in the project, so a Maven install 
is not actually needed. You may first need to execute `chmod +x mvnw`.

```
./mvnw clean package
docker build -t ${artifactId}:v1 .
```

You can then run the Docker image by executing:

```
#if (${runtime} != 'open-liberty')
docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 ${artifactId}:v1
#else
docker run -it --rm -p 9080:9080 ${artifactId}:v1
#end
```

#if (${runtime} != 'open-liberty')
#if (${profile} != 'core')
Once the runtime starts, you can access the project at [http://localhost:8080/${artifactId}](http://localhost:8080/${artifactId}).
#else
Once the runtime starts, you can access the REST end-point at [http://localhost:8080/${artifactId}/rest/hello](http://localhost:8080/${artifactId}/rest/hello).
#end
#else
#if (${profile} != 'core')
Once the runtime starts, you can access the project at [http://localhost:9080/](http://localhost:9080/).
#else
Once the runtime starts, you can access the REST end-point at [http://localhost:9080/rest/hello](http://localhost:9080/rest/hello).
#end
#end
#end
#else
* You can build the application by executing the following command from the directory where this file resides. 
Please ensure you have installed a [Java SE implementation](https://adoptium.net) appropriate for your 
Jakarta EE version (this sample assumes Java SE ${javaVersion}). Note, 
the [Maven Wrapper](https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/) is already included in the project, so a Maven install 
is not actually needed. You may first need to execute `chmod +x mvnw`.

  ```
  ./mvnw clean package
  ```
 
This will generate a file named `${artifactId}.war`. You should be able to run the application by deploying 
the file to a [Jakarta EE compatible runtime](https://jakarta.ee/compatibility).
