# Eclipse Starter for Jakarta EE
This is a sample application generated by the Eclipse Foundation Starter for Jakarta EE.

## Running the Application
#if (${runtime} != 'none')
You can run the application by executing the following command from the directory where this file resides. 
Please ensure you have installed a [Java SE implementation](https://adoptium.net) appropriate for your 
Jakarta EE version and runtime choice (this sample assumes Java SE ${javaVersion}). 
#if (${buildSystem} == 'gradle')
Note, the [Gradle Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) is already included in the project, so a Gradle install 
is not actually needed. You may first need to execute `chmod +x gradlew`.
#else
Note, the [Maven Wrapper](https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/) is already included in the project, so a Maven install 
is not actually needed. You may first need to execute `chmod +x mvnw`.
#end

```
#if (${buildSystem} == 'gradle')
    #if ((${runtime} == 'payara') && (${profile} != 'full'))
./gradlew clean build payaraStart
    #elseif ((${runtime} == 'payara') || (${runtime} == 'glassfish'))
./gradlew clean build cargoRunLocal
    #elseif (${runtime} == 'tomee')
./gradlew clean build tomeeRun
    #elseif (${runtime} == 'wildfly')
./gradlew clean build wildflyRun
    #elseif (${runtime} == 'open-liberty')
./gradlew clean build libertyRun
    #end
#else
    #if ((${runtime} == 'payara') && (${profile} != 'full'))
./mvnw clean package payara-micro:start
    #elseif ((${runtime} == 'payara') || (${runtime} == 'glassfish'))
./mvnw clean package cargo:run
    #elseif (${runtime} == 'tomee')
./mvnw clean package tomee:run
    #elseif (${runtime} == 'wildfly')
./mvnw clean package wildfly:run
    #elseif (${runtime} == 'open-liberty')
./mvnw clean package liberty:run
    #end
#end
```

    #if ((${runtime} == 'payara') && (${profile} != 'full'))
        #if (${profile} != 'core')
Once the runtime starts, you can access the project at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
        #else
Once the runtime starts, you can access the REST end-point at [http://localhost:8080/rest/hello](http://localhost:8080/rest/hello).
        #end
    #elseif (${runtime} == 'open-liberty')
        #if (${profile} != 'core')
Once the runtime starts, you can access the project at [http://localhost:9080](http://localhost:9080).
        #else
Once the runtime starts, you can access the REST end-point at [http://localhost:9080/rest/hello](http://localhost:9080/rest/hello).
        #end
    #else
        #if (${profile} != 'core')
Once the runtime starts, you can access the project at [http://localhost:8080/${artifactId}](http://localhost:8080/${artifactId}).
        #else
Once the runtime starts, you can access the REST end-point at [http://localhost:8080/${artifactId}/rest/hello](http://localhost:8080/${artifactId}/rest/hello).
        #end
    #end

    #if (((${docker} == 'yes') && (${runtime} != 'glassfish')) || ((${runtime} == 'glassfish') && (${docker} == 'yes') && (${jakartaVersion} == '10') && (${profile} == 'full') && (${javaVersion} == 17)))
You can also run the project via Docker. To build the Docker image, execute the following commands from the 
directory where this file resides. Please ensure you have installed 
a [Java SE implementation](https://adoptium.net) appropriate for your Jakarta EE version/runtime 
choice (this sample assumes Java SE ${javaVersion}) and 
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
#if (${buildSystem} == 'gradle')
Note, the [Gradle Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) is already included in the project, so a Gradle install 
is not actually needed. You may first need to execute `chmod +x gradlew`.
#else
Note, the [Maven Wrapper](https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/) is already included in the project, so a Maven install 
is not actually needed. You may first need to execute `chmod +x mvnw`.
#end

```
#if (${buildSystem} == 'gradle')
./gradlew clean build
#else
./mvnw clean package
#end
docker build -t ${artifactId}:v1 .
```

You can then run the Docker image by executing:

```
        #if (${runtime} != 'open-liberty')
docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 ${artifactId}:v1
        #else
docker run -it --rm -p 9080:9080 ${artifactId}:v1
        #end
```

        #if (${runtime} != 'open-liberty')
            #if (${profile} != 'core')
Once the runtime starts, you can access the project at [http://localhost:8080/${artifactId}](http://localhost:8080/${artifactId}).
            #else
Once the runtime starts, you can access the REST end-point at [http://localhost:8080/${artifactId}/rest/hello](http://localhost:8080/${artifactId}/rest/hello).
            #end
        #else
            #if (${profile} != 'core')
Once the runtime starts, you can access the project at [http://localhost:9080/](http://localhost:9080/).
            #else
Once the runtime starts, you can access the REST end-point at [http://localhost:9080/rest/hello](http://localhost:9080/rest/hello).
            #end
        #end
    #end
#else
* You can build the application by executing the following command from the directory where this file resides. 
Please ensure you have installed a [Java SE implementation](https://adoptium.net) appropriate for your 
Jakarta EE version (this sample assumes Java SE ${javaVersion}).
#if (${buildSystem} == 'gradle')
Note, the [Gradle Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) is already included in the project, so a Gradle install 
is not actually needed. You may first need to execute `chmod +x gradlew`.
#else
Note, the [Maven Wrapper](https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/) is already included in the project, so a Maven install 
is not actually needed. You may first need to execute `chmod +x mvnw`.
#end

  ```
#if (${buildSystem} == 'gradle')
  ./gradlew clean build
#else
  ./mvnw clean package
#end
  ```
 
This will generate a file named `${artifactId}.war`. You should be able to run the application by deploying 
the file to a [Jakarta EE compatible runtime](https://jakarta.ee/compatibility).
