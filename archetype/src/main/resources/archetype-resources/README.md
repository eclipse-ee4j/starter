# Eclipse Starter for Jakarta EE
This is a sample application generated by the Eclipse Foundation starter for Jakarta EE.

## Running the Application
#if (${runtime} != 'none')
You can run the application by executing the following command from the directory where this file resides. Please ensure you have installed a [Java SE 8+ implementation](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk8) (we have tested with Java SE 8, Java SE 11 and Java SE 17). Note, the [Maven Wrapper](https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/) is already included in the project, so a Maven install is not actually needed.

```
#if ((${runtime} == 'payara') && (${profile} != 'full'))
./mvnw clean package payara-micro:start
#elseif ((${runtime} == 'payara') || (${runtime} == 'glassfish'))
./mvnw clean package cargo:run
#elseif (${runtime} == 'tomee')
./mvnw clean package tomee:run
#elseif (${runtime} == 'wildfly')
./mvnw clean package wildfly:run
#elseif (${runtime} == 'open-liberty')
./mvnw clean package liberty:run
#end
```

#if ((${runtime} == 'payara') && (${profile} != 'full'))
Once the runtime starts, you can access the project at http://localhost:8080.
#elseif (${runtime} == 'open-liberty')
Once the runtime starts, you can access the project at http://localhost:9080/jakartaee-hello-world.
#else
Once the runtime starts, you can access the project at http://localhost:8080/jakartaee-hello-world.
#end

#if ((${docker} == 'yes') and ((${runtime} == 'tomee') or (${runtime} == 'wildfly') or (${runtime} == 'open-liberty') or ((${runtime} == 'payara') and (${jakartaVersion} == '8'))))
You can also run the project via Docker. To build the Docker image, execute the following commands from the directory where this file resides. Please ensure you have installed a [Java SE 8+ implementation](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk8) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (we have tested with Java SE 8, Java SE 11 and Java SE 17). Note, the [Maven Wrapper](https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/) is already included in the project, so a Maven install is not actually needed.

```
./mvnw clean package
docker build -t jakartaee-hello-world:v1 .
```

You can then run the Docker image by executing:

```
#if (${runtime} != 'open-liberty')
docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 jakartaee-hello-world:v1
#else
docker run -it --rm -p 9080:9080 jakartaee-hello-world:v1
#end
```

#if (${runtime} != 'open-liberty')
Once the runtime starts, you can access the project at http://localhost:8080/jakartaee-hello-world.
#else
Once the runtime starts, you can access the project at http://localhost:9080/jakartaee-hello-world.
#end
#end
#else
* You can build the application by executing the following command from the directory where this file resides. Please ensure you have installed a [Java SE 8 implementation](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk8). Note, the [Maven Wrapper](https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/) is already included in the project, so a Maven install is not actually needed.

  ```
  ./mvnw clean package
  ```
 
  This will generate a file named `jakartaee-hello-world.war`. You should be able to run the application by deploying the file to
  a [Jakarta EE compatible runtime](https://jakarta.ee/compatibility).
